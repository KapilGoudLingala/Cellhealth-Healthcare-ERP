## Project Overview

CellHealth is a Healthcare ERP platform implemented to **digitize and standardize
end-to-end clinical operations** of a Cell Health Clinic, where multiple departments
collaborate on a single patient visit.

Each patient interaction typically involves several teams—counsellors, doctors,
laboratory staff, billing, pharmacy, and nutritionists—making coordination and
data consistency a critical challenge.

### Key Operational Challenges
- Managing multiple clinical consultations within one visit
- Handling laboratory diagnostics and result tracking
- Performing billing at different stages of treatment
- Controlling pharmacy dispensing based on prescriptions
- Planning and delivering personalized nutrition guidance

### Solution Approach
These challenges were addressed by implementing a **workflow-driven ERP
architecture** centered around a single Patient Encounter.

The system enforces:
- Structured workflow transitions between departments
- Role-based responsibilities and approvals
- A unified source of patient data throughout the visit

This approach ensures operational clarity, clinical accuracy, and full
accountability across all departments involved in patient care.
