## Project Overview

CellHealth was implemented to digitize and automate the operations of a Cell Health Clinic where multiple departments interact with a single patient during one visit.

The challenge was managing:
- Multiple consultations
- Lab diagnostics
- Billing at different stages
- Pharmacy dispensing
- Nutrition planning

This was solved using a **workflow-driven ERP architecture**, ensuring controlled transitions and role-based accountability.
